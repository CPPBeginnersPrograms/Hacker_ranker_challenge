//You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for
//each year of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
//Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
//
//
//For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4,4 ,3,1,
//she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.


//Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles in the editor below. It must return an
//integer representing the number of candles she can blow out.
//birthdayCakeCandles has the following parameter(s):
//ar: an array of integers representing candle heights
